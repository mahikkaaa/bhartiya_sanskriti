# bhartiya_sanskriti

We frequently miss out on notifications about events that are going on around us. Bhartiya Sanskriti comes forth with the goal of informing the public about anything and everything that will be happening in each state, in informing them and keep them from losing out on the important ones.

Bhartiya Sanskriti seeks to provide you with experiences all over India that are worth your time and money, and to maybe inspire you to try something new. Youâ€™ll find everything you need to cure your post-work blues or make your weekend (even) better here.

Explore live events (music, comedy, theatre, art); dining experiences; weekend excursions (treks, adventure, tours, travel, cycling, amusement parks); and live sport (cricket, football, kabaddi, badminton) matches; workshops (photography, marketing, cuisine, baking, painting) and more.
